# Billboard Signup Footer

A loud, single-colour closing section. The brand is set as a giant condensed
wordmark that grows out of the footer's body, cropped by the top edge. Under it
sit an email pill, a row of socials, four link columns and a slogan ticker,
with a chat bubble parked on the ticker.

The wordmark is **a mask, not paint**. A paper panel sits on top with the
letters cut out of it. The orange you see through them is the footer's own
background, the same surface the pill and columns sit on, so the letters run
straight into the body. The cut-out shapes come from a built-in stroke alphabet
(A–Z, 0–9, space, `- . ! '`) drawn into an SVG `<mask>`, so it looks the same
on every installer's machine and no font is downloaded.

**No dependencies.** React is the only import. No images, fonts or requests.

## Interaction

- **Sheen**: a soft light follows the pointer across the footer's background.
  The paper hides it, so it shows only through the letter holes and on the
  body. That's how you can tell the letters are cut out.
- **Piano-key letters**: the holes under the pointer slide down into the body,
  falling off smoothly with distance. **Click** a letter and it gets struck: it
  dips and springs back. On touch, drag across the word.
- **Reveal**: the first time the footer is on screen, the letters rise out of
  the body one after another with a small overshoot, the column hairlines draw
  in and the links fade up.
- **Signup**: the pill checks the address. A bad address shakes the pill and
  shows a hint, and typing clears it. While `onSubscribe` runs, the button
  shows bouncing dots. On success the pill shows a check and the address, the
  button bursts into confetti, a **glissando** runs across the wordmark, and a
  "Use another email" link resets the form. Failures shake and show the message.
- **Ticker**: it slows to a crawl under the pointer. **Drag** it to scrub and
  let go to fling it, then it eases back to cruising speed.
- **Socials**: each one flips to a white disc with a tilted label.
- **Links**: an underline draws in and the label nudges right.
- **Chat bubble**: opens a small card with a status line, a message and a call
  to action. Click outside or press Escape to close it. Focus goes back to the
  bubble.

## Usage

```tsx
import BillboardSignupFooter from "@/components/ui/billboard-signup-footer"

<BillboardSignupFooter
  brand="Voltra"
  onSubscribe={async (email) => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/subscribe", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ email }) })
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Couldn't sign you up. Try again?")
  }}
/>
```

Give it a parent with a width and nothing else (see `demo.tsx`). Its height
comes from its content: the wordmark's height comes from its own `viewBox`, so
nothing is measured.

Re-brand and re-ink it through props (see `demo.tsx`):

```tsx
<BillboardSignupFooter
  brand="Pulse 24"
  accent="#2342ff" paper="#eef0f7" tickerInk="#0d1033"
  ticker={{ lead: "Pulse", items: ["check, every Friday", "of the city"], speed: 90 }}
  chat={{ title: "Pulse 24 desk", status: "On air until 6pm", href: "mailto:desk@pulse24.fm" }}
/>
```

## Props

| Prop | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | `"Voltra"` | Used for the wordmark, the ticker's lead word, the chat card's title and its avatar. |
| `wordmark` | `brand` | What the wordmark spells. Lower case is drawn as capitals. Characters the alphabet doesn't have are dropped. A short word is padded sideways, so it is never taller than 1/2.4 of the width. |
| `onSubscribe` | fake 900ms success | `(email) => void \| boolean \| string \| Promise<…>`. Called only with a valid address. Return nothing or `true` for success, a string to use as the success message, or `false` for the generic error. Throw an `Error` to show its message. |
| `placeholder` / `buttonLabel` / `tagline` | as in the reference | The tagline is the line under the pill. Status messages replace it. |
| `successMessage` / `invalidMessage` / `errorMessage` | friendly defaults | |
| `socials` | Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Instagram | `{ label, href?, icon }[]`. `icon` is `"facebook" \| "linkedin" \| "x" \| "instagram" \| "youtube" \| "github"`, or your own 24×24 SVG children. |
| `columns` | Support, Product, Company, Legal | `{ title, links: { label, href? }[] }[]`. Any number fit side by side. Under 640px they pair up. `tel:` and `mailto:` hrefs work as usual. |
| `ticker` | brand + four slogans | `{ lead, items, speed? }`. `speed` is px/s, default 60. `0` holds it still, but it can still be dragged. `false` removes the ticker. |
| `chat` | a card for the brand | `{ title?, status?, message?, actionLabel?, href? }`, merged over the defaults. `false` removes the bubble. |
| `onLinkClick` | none | `(label, href)` for every social, column and chat link. |
| `crop` | `6` | Glyph units (of a 100-unit cap) cut off the top of the wordmark. `0` shows the full letters. |
| `tracking` | `3` | Glyph units between letters. |
| `press` | `0.3` | How deep a key goes under the pointer, as a fraction of cap height. `0` turns hover pressing off. Clicks still strike. |
| `shine` | `0.14` | Strength of the pointer sheen on the background, 0 → 1. `0` turns it off. |
| `accent` | `#ff4419` | Hex. The footer's background, which shows through the letters. Also the ticker's lead word and the chat bubble. |
| `paper` | `#f6f5f2` | Hex. The panel the letters are cut out of, and the ticker. |
| `ink` | `#ffffff` | Hex. Text on the accent and the button's fill. |
| `tickerInk` | `#141414` | Hex. Ticker text. |
| `fontSans` | grotesque stack, ending in the system sans | Nothing is loaded. Pass a family your page already loads. The wordmark doesn't use it. |
| `className` | `""` | Appended to the root `<footer>`. |

## Notes

- **Intrinsic height.** No `height` prop and no percentage heights. The
  wordmark is an `<svg>` at `width: 100%` with an `aspect-ratio` from its
  `viewBox`.
- **The mask.** Inside the `<mask>`, a white rect keeps the paper and the
  letters, stroked black, cut it away. Only the paper rect is masked. Nothing
  in the band is painted the accent, so a background you put on the footer
  (via `className` or `accent`) shows through the letters too. Each instance
  gets its own mask id.
- **The alphabet** is centre-line paths with a 20-unit stroke on a 100-unit
  cap. Each glyph is a nested `<svg>` that clips to its own box. That trims
  miters and squares off strokes that run past the edge, which is how the `Z`,
  `T` and `V` get their flat ends.
- **No seam.** The paper stops half a unit above the baseline. If the letter
  holes and the paper ended on the same line, both edges would be smoothed
  and leave a paper-coloured hairline under the letters at fractional sizes.
- The keys and the ticker write SVG transforms and CSS straight to the DOM from
  `requestAnimationFrame`, so React never re-renders. The key loop sleeps once
  every spring settles. The ticker only runs while it is on screen.
- The chat bubble is positioned inside the footer, never `position: fixed`, so
  it can't cover the host page.
- The CSS is one scoped `<style>` block, with every rule under `.bsf`. Element
  resets go through `:where(.bsf)`, so they never out-rank the component's own
  classes or yours. It sizes off its own width with container queries.
- The footer paints its own palette and ignores the page's light/dark theme.
- `href: "#"` and missing hrefs never touch the page's URL hash. External
  `http(s)` links open in a new tab.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: the letters are in place at once and never press
  or bounce, the ticker holds still (dragging still works), and there are no
  shakes, confetti, pulses or transitions. The sheen still follows the
  pointer, without easing in.

## Credit

Layout and palette after a reference shot of a hiring product's footer. The
stroke alphabet, the piano-key letters, the signup states, the ticker
physics, the chat card and the code are original. The default brand
("Voltra") and copy are placeholders.
