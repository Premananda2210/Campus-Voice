# Silhouette Wrap

A paragraph that parts around a falling silhouette, follows its **actual
outline** — a keyhole's waist, a bottle's neck — and closes back up underneath.
Scroll and the shape drops through the column; every line is set again.

CSS floats text past a `shape-outside` on one side of one box. Text that opens
around an object mid-column and rejoins below it is a layout no browser will
do. So this does the typesetting itself:

- canvas `measureText` for word widths, cached per font
- `Intl.Segmenter` for break opportunities, so CJK breaks where it should
- your SVG shapes rasterised **once** into a left/right scanline profile, then
  asked for their width at each line

Nothing measures the DOM, so the fall costs no reflow: each frame is a profile
lookup and one greedy pass over cached widths.

**No dependencies.** React is the only import — Tailwind utilities, no CSS file,
no animation library.

## Usage

```tsx
import SilhouetteWrap from "@/components/ui/silhouette-wrap"

<SilhouetteWrap />                                   // keyhole, falls with scroll
<SilhouetteWrap silhouette={{ src: "/dragon.png" }} size={280} />
<SilhouetteWrap silhouette={{ box: [100, 140], shapes: [{ path: "M…Z" }] }} text={copy} />
```

It sizes itself — the height comes from the lines it set, so it drops into a
column with no height prop and no `h-full`. Put a font on an ancestor and it
measures in *that* font: the type is the host's, the layout is this component's.

## Props

| Prop | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | the fall, from chapter I | The passage to typeset. |
| `silhouette` | `"keyhole"` | `keyhole` \| `bottle` \| `teapot` \| `circle` \| `diamond`, `{ box, shapes }`, or `{ src }`. |
| `size` | `190` | Silhouette width in px, before the column has its say. |
| `follow` | `"pointer"` | `pointer` eases after the cursor, `scroll` falls with the page, `drag` waits to be dragged, `fixed` holds still. |
| `chase` | `0.17` | Seconds to close most of the distance to the pointer. |
| `alive` | `true` | Bob, wingbeat and bank into the turn — transform only, never a re-typeset. |
| `travel` | `[0.06, 0.82]` | Fractions of the paragraph the fall runs between. |
| `drift` | `46` | Sideways drift over the fall, in px, so no two lines break alike. |
| `origin` | `{ x: 0.52, y: 0.42 }` | Where a `fixed` silhouette sits. |
| `gutter` | `18` | Clear space held between outline and text. |
| `minRun` | `9em` | Narrowest strip worth setting. The silhouette shrinks to respect it, and any run under it is left empty instead of taking one orphaned word. |
| `justify` | `true` | Stretch spaces so both edges of every run line up, where it can be done cleanly. |
| `tolerance` | `0.62` | How far a space may stretch before the line is left ragged instead. |
| `dropCap` | `3` | Lines tall for the opening capital. `0` turns it off. |
| `rubricLines` / `rubricColor` | `0` / — | Opening lines set in red, the way a scribe wrote an incipit. |
| `cap` | — | An illuminated initial for the drop cap's notch, which becomes a square. |
| `maxLines` | `500` | Safety cap. |
| `children` | — | Painted inside the outline instead of the default fill. |
| `className` | `""` | Appended to the root. |

### A silhouette can be an image

```tsx
<SilhouetteWrap silhouette={{ src: "/dragon.png" }} />
```

The image is drawn once into a small offscreen canvas and its matte is read
into the same scanline profile the vector shapes feed, so the text wraps the
real artwork — wings, spines, tail and all — and every later frame is still
just an array lookup. `matte` picks what counts as the subject: `alpha` for a
cut-out PNG, `luma` for ink on a white ground, and `auto` (the default) uses
transparency when the image has any and darkness when it does not — so a
generated illustration works without cutting it out first.

Cross-origin art needs CORS headers, or `getImageData` taints the canvas and
throws; that is caught, and the image is stacked above the text rather than
rendering nothing.

### Silhouettes are also a set of shapes

```tsx
{ box: [170, 150], shapes: [
    { path: "M104 44 A42 42 0 1 0 108 110", width: 17 },  // stroked: a coiled body
    { path: "M132 18 C146 14 …Z" },                        // filled: the head
] }
```

A `width` strokes the path at that thickness instead of filling it, which is how
the dragon's body is authored as a *line* that tapers head to tail rather than
as both sides of an outline. The profile is sampled in the art's own coordinates
so a stroke width means the same thing to the sampler as it does to the SVG.

`children` replaces the drawing, so the outline can carry artwork: the default
demo puts a gilded sun inside the dragon's coil, the bottle demo paints a DRINK
ME label. Left alone the silhouette is solid ink, and since it inherits `color`,
a dark page turns it into light coming through the keyhole.

## Three things it gets right that are easy to get wrong

**Narrow runs are not justified.** Justification beside a silhouette is where
shaped text usually falls apart: a six-word run stretched to both edges opens
rivers you can see from across the room. Any line needing more than `tolerance`
of extra space per gap is set ragged instead. Wide lines still justify, so the
column keeps a clean left and right edge and the text still hugs the outline —
which is the whole point of doing this at all.


**The drop cap is measured, not guessed.** A cap sized by a magic ratio either
collides with the text or floats above its baseline. This asks the font:
`actualBoundingBoxAscent` for how tall that particular glyph draws, the font's
own ascent/descent for where CSS puts a baseline inside a line box. The cap's
top then lands on the first line's cap-height and its baseline on the last line
it spans, which is the rule a compositor would use.

**The beast moves without the page moving.** The bob, the wingbeat and the bank
into a turn are written straight to the art's `transform` on their own frame
loop — they never touch the layout. The paragraph is set around the silhouette's
envelope and the art lives inside it, so a beast that is constantly in motion
costs one style write per frame instead of a re-typeset per frame. Following the
pointer *does* re-typeset, and at about 0.2ms a pass that is affordable.

**A line band is cleared at its widest point.** Measuring the shape at the line's
midpoint lets a glyph clip the corner of anything that pinches — exactly what a
keyhole does at its waist. Every scanline the band touches is checked, and the
widest wins.

## What it does on a phone

A 210px silhouette in a 342px column leaves ~30px runs: one word per line,
rivers, and long words spilling out. So the silhouette gives way in two stages —
it shrinks until both runs clear `minRun`, and when no width can manage that,
the wrap is abandoned: the silhouette sits full-size above a plain column and
the drop cap moves down with the text. `fitSilhouette()` is the whole rule, and
it is tested.

## Notes

- `prefers-reduced-motion` parks the fall and sets the paragraph once.
- Scroll reads coalesce to one re-typeset per frame via `requestAnimationFrame`,
  and the listener is passive, so a fast wheel never fights the compositor.
- No `Path2D` (older engines, some capture sandboxes) degrades to the stacked
  layout instead of throwing.
- The positioned fragments are `aria-hidden`; the real paragraph ships as
  `sr-only` text, so selection, search and screen readers get prose rather than
  a pile of spans.
- A webfont that lands after first paint changes every width, so layout re-runs
  on `document.fonts.ready` and on any column resize.
- Colours are the host's semantic tokens, so it works in both themes untouched.

## The demos

- **default** — an illuminated folio: parchment, a gold-ground initial, a
  rubricated incipit, and a dragon that chases the cursor, banks into its turns
  and breathes sparks, with Revelation 12 (KJV, 1611, public domain) set around
  its outline. The beast is a generated illustration (muapi / nano-banana),
  cropped to the ink, given an alpha channel from its own luma and inlined in
  the demo — the silhouette is read from those pixels.
- **keyhole** — Alice's fall, chapter I, the keyhole dropping through the column.
- **bottle** — a fixed silhouette carrying its own label.
